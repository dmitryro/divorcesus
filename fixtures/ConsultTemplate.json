(hereinafter referred to as the \u201cFirm\u201d), is subject to the following terms and conditions.\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\nPrior to the legal consultation, we need to identify all parties involved in your situation. Identification of all parties involved is necessary so that we may assess whether there is a conflict of interest preventing the attorney from providing you with a legal consultation. Please note that the quality of the consultation depends, in large measure, on the accuracy of the information you provide on this consultation form. The more precise and reliable the information you provide the more specific and useful the consultation will be.\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\nPLEASE NOTE\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n============\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\nYour request for an online consultation creates only a limited attorney-client relationship, which terminates at the completion of the consultation. The consultation is not intended to and does not under any circumstances, create an on-going attorney-client relationship.  The said limited attorney-client relationship created by the online consultation exists  for the sole purpose of providing advice during the consultation and only with respect to the questions posed.  As such, unless the Firm  agrees to represent you and you enter into  a written agreement with the Firm, manually signed by one of the Firm's attorneys, neither the attorney providing the answer or consultation nor the Firm is or shall be your attorney-of-record in any pending matter. \r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\nPLEASE UNDERSTAND\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n===================\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\nIn order to formally engage the Firm you would need to request a written Retainer Agreement from the Firm, execute the Agreement by manually signing and initialing it in all appropriate places, and return it to the Firm by regular mail, and not via email or any other form of electronic communication. Upon receipt by the Firm, the Retainer Agreement will be reviewed and manually signed by the Firm's designated attorney, thus completing the execution of the Agreement. Once the Retainer Agreement is fully executed, you will be provided a copy of the Retainer Agreement and the Firm will keep the original Retainer Agreement in your file with the Firm. You are not a client of the Firm until the Retainer Agreement is fully executed by both you and the Firm and you have paid any requisite retainer fee to the Firm, when applicable.  At that point you are a client of the Firm and a formal lasting attorney-client relationship exists. Such relationship shall then continue until terminated by either you or the Firm in accordance with the terms of the Retainer Agreement.\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\nPLEASE FURTHER NOTE\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\n===================\r\n</section>\r\n<section>\r\nAt times, the law may require you to take action within a specified period of time or you will  lose your rights to file for said relief or other benefit to which you may be entitled under the law.  This firm will not be responsible for compliance with any such deadline, unless the Firm has been formally engaged in the manner explained above and you have previously provided all necessary and accurate information to the Firm that is required for the action.\r\n</section>", "disclaimer": "", "consultation_type": null}}]
