However, the process for adoption is not necessarily straightforward, and prospective adoptive parents must go through the proper procedures in order to complete an adoption. Here, we will provide a brief overview of adoptions in New York and New Jersey along with information about how the experienced family law attorneys at The Law Offices of Grinberg &amp; Segal, PLLC can help guide parents through the adoption process. This article is not intended to be in any way comprehensive, and individuals with case-specific questions should schedule a case-specific consultation.</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><h4><strong>Adoption in New York</strong></h4></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><p>Under New York law, unmarried adults, married adults, and unmarried adults who are living together may adopt a child. Two adults living together who seek to adopt a child may be of the same sex or different sexes. A person who is married but living separate and apart from his or her spouse under a separation decree, judgment, or divorce may adopt a child. Finally, an adult married person who has been living separate and apart from his or her spouse for at least three years may seek to adopt a child. It is worth noting that an adoption may not be denied on grounds of race; religion; fertility; gender preference; marital status; income; employment; or education.</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><p>New York state law recognizes two distinct adoption procedures for adoptions that take place in New York State.</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><p>First, there is the \u201cagency adoption\u201d process. In this process, an agency authorized by New York places a child in a home for adoption. To adopt a child under this process, the prospective parent(s) must work with an approved adoption agency. The agency will be required to screen prospective parent(s) to ensure that the child will be placed in a safe and suitable home environment. In order to commence the agency adoption process, the prospective parent(s) must file an application in court. After filing for adoption, parent(s) will be required to undergo what is called a \u201chome study process.\u201d The adoption agency will be required to assess the suitability of the prospective parent(s) to care for the specific child. Adoption proceedings require the submission to the court of extensive documentation establishing the suitability of the parent(s) and the eligibility of the child to be adopted. For this reason, adoptive parents are strongly advised to retain an experienced adoption attorney for guidance through the process.</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><p>The second process is called the \u201cprivate placement\u201d process. Under this process, the child is put up for adoption by his or her birth parent(s) rather than by an authorized adoption agency. Accordingly, the prospective adoptive parent(s) must enter into an agreement with the birth parent(s). Parent(s) seeking to adopt a child through private placement will be required to obtain certification as qualified adoptive parents from a court of competent jurisdiction under New York law. The issues considered by the court for certification are similar to those considered in the agency adoption process. Also similarly, the adoption must be approved through adoption proceedings in court.</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><p>In order to adopt a child who resides in the United States but not in New York state, prospective parent(s) will first have to obtain permission for the child to be moved in accordance with the provisions of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC).</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><h4><strong>Adoptions in New Jersey</strong></h4></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><p>In New Jersey, a single adult, married adults, or adults in a domestic partnership or civil union may adopt a child.</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><p>Similar to New York, children in New Jersey may be adopted privately or through an approved adoption agency. If the prospective parent(s) are seeking to adopt from an approved agency, they will, as they would in New York, be required to undergo a home study. If the adoption agency determines that the prospective parent(s) are suitable, it may, in its discretion, attempt to match the parent(s) with a child who the agency believes would be a good fit in the home. Once a pairing is settled upon, New Jersey law requires that the child must reside with the prospective adoptive parent(s) for six months before they may file what is called a \u201ccomplaint for adoption\u201d with the court. The agency must also consent to this application. The court reviews the qualifications of the parents, the situation of the child, and renders a decision based on the agency\u2019s report and whether the adoption would promote the best interests of the child.</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><p>With regard to private adoptions, prospective parents are permitted to pay or reimburse the birth parent for medical, hospital, counseling, or other similar expenses in connection with the birth or any illness of the child, or any <em>reasonable&nbsp;</em>living expenses of the mother during her pregnancy. However, these payments may not continue beyond four weeks after the termination of the pregnancy by birth or otherwise. A prospective adoptive parent is well advised to consult with an experienced family law attorney for guidance on the rules surrounding such reimbursement.</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><p>As is the case in New York, a parent in New Jersey seeking to adopt a child from out of state must first obtain permission for the child to move through the ICPC.</p></section>\r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4></section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<span>\r\nAt the Law Offices of Grinberg &amp; Segal, PLLC, our attorneys understand how special providing an adoptive child with a loving home is, and we are ready to provide our expertise to help parents through the process.

NY Dom Rel L sec. 170 (2016) explains that if the husband and wife have lived separate and apart for one or more years under the terms of a separation agreement, and the plaintiff establishes that he or she performed all of the terms of the agreement, this may be used as a ground for divorce.\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<h4><strong>Agreements Made Before or During a Marriage</strong></h4>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>NY&nbsp;Dom Rel L sec. 236 (2016)&nbsp;explains that an agreement made between the parties before or during a marriage will be valid so long as it is in writing, subscribed to by the parties, and properly recorded as a deed. &nbsp;Such agreements may include, but are not limited to:</p>\r\n<section class=\"shift-right\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Contract to make a testamentary provision;&nbsp;<br></li>\r\n<li>A waiver of any right to elect against the provisions of a will;<br></li><li>Provision for the ownership, division, or distribution of separate and marital property;<br></li><li>Provision for the amount and duration of maintenance (alimony)&nbsp;or other terms and conditions of the marital relationship; or<br></li><li>Provision for child custody or support.<br></li></ul>\r\n</section>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>New Jersey has similar laws at NJ Rev Stat 37:2-34 (2016). &nbsp;Under these provisions, a premarital (or pre-civil union)&nbsp;agreement may include:</p>\r\n<section class=\"shift-right\">\r\n<ul><li>The rights or obligations of each party to the property of either party or both parties;</li><li>The right to manage or control property;</li><li>The disposition of property upon separation, marital dissolution, the death of one of the parties, or the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any other event;</li><li>The modification or elimination of support;</li><li>The making of a will or trust;</li><li>The ownership rights and disposition of a death benefit or life insurance policy;</li><li>The choice of law governing the construction of the agreement; or</li><li>Any other matter that is not a violation of public policy.</li></ul>\r\n</section>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n\r\n<p>One party may argue that such an agreements is unenforceable. If a party establishes that he or she did not have the opportunity to consult with legal counsel, an agreement may be found to be unenforceable. Furthermore, if one party was not forthright about his or her earnings, property, and/or financial obligations when entering into the agreement, the agreement may be found to be unenforceable. Finally, if one party establishes that he or she entered into the agreement under duress, the agreement may be found to be unenforceable. The burden will be upon the party alleging that the agreement is unenforceable to establish such. For example, in NJ Rev Stat sec. 37:2-38 (2016), the burden is on the party alleging the agreement is unenforceable to prove such by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d<br></p><h4><strong>Agreements in Lieu of Proceedings</strong></h4></section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>In seeking a divorce, the parties may seek to resolve their disagreements by way of coming to an agreement, sometimes through the formal process of divorce mediation.  Coming to an agreement may spare the parties from months of litigation in contested divorce proceedings.  While such an agreement may not be the appropriate resolution in every situation, it is worth considering by the parties and their attorneys whether it is possible to resolve disputed issues without a court order.\r\n</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Note on Custody of the Children</strong>\r\n</h4>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>Notwithstanding any agreements, a judge is required to consider, first and foremost, the best interests of the child in making any child custody determinations.  While a judge will consider any agreements entered into between the parties concerning the custody and support of children, he or she will still have the discretion to render an order contrary to the agreement if such would serve the best interests of the child.\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>\r\n</h4>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>When entering into an agreement with a spouse or fianc\u00e9e, it is wise to consult with an experienced family law.  Firstly, if an agreement is not well-written with respect to the relevant laws of the state, it may do little to resolve the issues.  Secondly, if there is a lack of regularity in the process of entering into an agreement, this may lead to one party challenging its validity and enforceability at a later date.  Finally, an attorney may help his or her client review the agreement carefully to ensure that the client understand all it entails.  At The Law Offices of Grinberg &amp; Segal, PLLC, we have extensive experience in reviewing agreements, helping parties reach agreements (before or during marriage as well as after the commencement of a divorce action), and ensuring that the rights and interests of our clients are protected.\r\n</p>\r\n</section>", "service": "servces/Cohabitation-Agreement.jpg", "nick": "agreements"}}, {"model": "gui.service", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "Contested Divorce", "statement": "Contested Divorces - Where the parties disagree", "time_published": "2017-12-18T02:29:31.214Z", "description": "<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<h3><strong>Contested Divorce</strong>\r\n</h3>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>A contested divorce occurs when one party in the proceeding opposes a divorce action.

Divorces are civil matters and a contested divorce may be resolved by a judge under the laws of the state in which it occurs.  For example, the New York Courts System advises that a contested divorce will require the parties to go to Supreme Court \u201cnumerous times.\u201d  NJ Court Rule 5:1-4 explains that the length of time that it may take for a contested divorce to be resolved will depend upon the issues presented.  Certain matters may be placed on the \u201cstandard\u201d track, whereas more complicated cases may be placed on the \u201cComplex Track\u201d and take longer.  Cases that involve custody or parenting-time issues may be placed on the \u201cPriority Track\u201d for expeditious adjudication of these issues in the best interest of the child(ren).\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>In short, a contested divorce is a lawsuit.  It will involve pleadings, discovery motions, and potentially a trial before a judge (and in some cases, a jury).  It is extremely important to consult with an experienced divorce attorney if a divorce is contested, both to ensure that one\u2019s interests are protected and that every avenue is explored for a potentially amicable solution (if appropriate).  Judges will make child custody determination, and either party can request that a judge make a determination on select other matters at issue in the divorce (such as property division or spousal support).\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>In certain cases, it may be possible for the parties to reach a resolution without going to trial.  This can be accomplished through the parties coming to an agreement, whether through an informal process or through formal mediation.  Experienced family law attorneys may be able to help the parties see if there is a way to resolve the issues involved in the divorce without having to go through complex divorce proceedings.  However, certain cases may not be amenable to such a resolution.  Such cases may include those where one party is unwilling to negotiate, where the sides are too far apart on key issues, or situations where domestic violence is involved.\r\n</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>The experienced family law and divorce attorneys at The Law Office of Grinberg &amp; Segal, PLLC, are experts in handling all aspects of divorce proceedings \u2013 contested or uncontested \u2013 in New York and New Jersey.

Whether through proceedings or through an agreement, there may be a variety of custody arrangements from one parent having sole custody, both parents sharing joint custody, or any other arrangement that is found to be in the best interests of the child.  In most cases, a parent who is not granted joint or sole physical custody of the child will still be able to seek visitation rights.  It is crucial for a parent who is facing divorce to consult immediately with an experienced family law attorney for guidance on how to protect his or her interests as a parent in the course of divorce mediation or divorce proceedings. &nbsp;In this article, we will provide a brief overview of some of the significant child custody provisions in New York and New Jersey.</p>\r\n</section> \r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<h4>Child Custody and Visitation in New York</h4>\r\n</section> \r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>Under New York law, \u201ccustody\u201d has two components.

Child support may be negotiated and agreed upon by the parties in divorce mediations or may be determined and ordered by a judge in contested divorce proceedings.  Child support generally involves  the non-custodial parent of a child making negotiated or court ordered payments to the custodial parent.  Both New York and New Jersey have similar systems for calculating child support obligations. &nbsp;In this article, we will briefly examine a sampling of the significant child support provisions in New York and New Jersey.</p>\r\n </section> <section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Child Support in New York</strong></h4>\r\n </section> <section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n\r\n<p>The major statutes regarding child support in New York are found in NY Dom Rel L sec. 240  (2016).  The NY statutes define child support as money paid by one or both parents under a court order or under a valid agreement between the parties. If an agreement stipulates a child support amount that deviates from the payer's basic child support obligation under New York law, \"the  agreement  or stipulation must specify the amount that\r\n  such basic child support obligation would have been and  the  reason  or\r\n  reasons  that such agreement or stipulation does not provide for payment\r\n  of that amount...\" New York law has specific formulas for calculating the basic child support obligation based on an income shares model which takes into account the incomes of both parents and apportions from that a percentage of the income from the non-custodial parent. The New York rules are designed to ensure that child support does not place one party below the federal poverty level.\r\n</p>\r\n </section> <section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n\r\n<p>Courts may deviate from the basic child support obligation for the non-custodial parent based on the following factors (paraphrased):\r\n</p>\r\n </section> <section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<section class=\"shift-right\">\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The financial resources of the parents and those of the child;</li>\r\n\t<li>The physical and emotional health of the child and his or her special needs;</li>\r\n\t<li>The standard of living that the child would have had if the marriage or household had not been dissolved;</li>\r\n\t<li>The tax consequences to the parties;</li>\r\n\t<li>The non-monetary contributions that the parties will make toward the well-being of the child;</li>\r\n\t<li>The educational needs of either parent;</li>\r\n\t<li>The determination that the gross income of one parent is substantially less than the other parent\u2019s;</li><li>The needs of the children of the non-custodial parent who are not subject to the child support action in question;</li><li>The financial resources of any person obligated to support the children;</li><li>Provided that the child is not on public assistance, extraordinary expenses incurred by the non-custodial parent in exercising visitation; and</li>\r\n\t<li>Any other factors deemed relevant by the court.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n </section> <section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that spousal support and child support are distinct concepts, but may both be considered in determining the payees financial needs.\r\n</p>\r\n </section> <section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>Child Support in New Jersey</strong></h4>\r\n </section> <section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n\r\n<p>New Jersey's formulas for determining child support are similar to those in New York.  The New Jersey Rules of the Court set the standard that New Jersey will use the \u201cIncome Shares Approach\u201d to apportioning child rearing expenses.  This approach is used because New Jersey State law presumes that both parents are responsible for the care of the children. Accordingly, the amount of child support depends on a formula involving the combined income of both parents and the income of the payee.

NY Dom Rel L sec. 170 (2016).</p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>New Jersey State law includes conduct constituting \u201cextreme cruelty\u201d towards the plaintiff by the defendant as a ground for divorce.  The statutory definition includes both \u201cphysical and mental cruelty,\u201d   which must either endanger the safety or health of the plaintiff or make it improper or unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to continue to cohabit with the defendant. &nbsp;NJ Rev Stat sec. 2A:34-2 (2016).

An experienced attorney will be able to guide the domestic violence victim in obtaining potentially necessary forms of relief, such as an order of protection.  In proceedings, an attorney can help ensure that the victim\u2019s address and personal information will be kept from his or her abuser.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indeed, domestic violence often complicates divorce actions in that the circumstances of abuse and cruelty may make it impossible to resolve issues through out-of-court mediation rather than through formal court proceeding.  In such cases, an experienced attorney can help the victim defend his or her safety and future in court.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>If a party to divorce proceedings presents evidence that he or she was the victim of domestic violence, many aspects of the ultimate resolution of the divorce petition can be affected.  This may be true even if the domestic violence is not the ground upon which the divorce is based.  The following is a non-exhaustive list of matters that may be affected by allegations or evidence of spousal domestic violence or cruelty:\r\n</p>\r\n<section class=\"shift-right\">\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Child custody/visitation determinations (evidence of domestic violence against either the parent or child will be considered in custody and visitation determinations);</li>\r\n\t<li>Child support;</li>\r\n\t<li>Alimony/spousal support (<i>e.g., </i>NY Dom Rel L sec. 236 (2016) provides that domestic violence will be considered in any temporary maintenance determination insofar as the domestic violence inhibited or continues to inhibit the victim\u2019s capacity to gain employment);</li>\r\n\t<li>Allocation of marital assets.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</section>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>Other unique issues may also arise depending on the facts and the state.  For example, in New Jersey, divorced couples with children are generally required to undergo a \u201cParent\u2019s Education program\u201d in order to promote cooperation between divorced parents with regard to child rearing. NJ Rev Stat sec. 2A:34-12.3 (2016).

Marital property means all property acquired by one or both parties during the marriage and before the execution of a separation agreement or the commencement of a matrimonial action. Marital property is subject to distribution in a divorce. \"Separate property\" encompasses property that is not subject to division. Separate property includes property acquired before marriage, property acquired by bequest, devise, or descent, property that is a gift from someone other than the spouse, compensation for personal injuries, property acquired in exchange for or the increase in value of separate property (except insofar as the appreciation of value is due to the contributions or efforts of the other spouse), and property described as separate property by written agreement of the parties.</p>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>Valid written agreements entered into prior to or during the marriage are enforceable with regard to property division.

In this article, we will provide a very brief overview of alimony in New York and New Jersey.</p><h4>Alimony in New York</h4>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>The main statutes concerning alimony in New York are found in NY Dom. Rel. L. sec. 236 (2016).</p><p>New York law provides for \"temporary maintenance\" payments during divorce proceedings. Temporary maintenance terminates upon the culmination of the proceedings. The parties may reach their own agreement regarding temporary maintenance. &nbsp;However, if no such agreement is reached, the court may order temporary maintenance to be paid by the party with higher income to the party with lower income. The New York Courts website maintains a \u201cTemporary Maintenance Online Calculator\u201d which is based on the temporary maintenance factors outlined in statute. &nbsp;These formulas are designed to prevent the payer from falling below an income level at which he or she can sustain him or herself.</p></section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>New York's statutes also provide for post-divorce maintenance. payments. Alimony to be paid after a divorce is finalized can either be negotiated by the parties or ordered by a court based on the formulas in the New York statutes. In some cases, alimony may be paid as a single sum payment. \"Maintenance\" is defined as an agreed upon payment schedule, or a court-ordered payment schedule, where support is \"paid at fixed intervals for a definite or indefinite payment of time...\"</p><p>Post-divorce maintenance is calculated before child support is calculated. It is important to note that notwithstanding divorce maintenance factors, the amount of maintenance awarded cannot reduce the payer's income below the self-support reserve for a single person. Where a court orders maintenance, the duration of such maintenance will generally depend on the length of the marriage.</p><p>Courts have discretion to deviate from the post-divorce maintenance guidelines based on several factors. &nbsp;These factors are listed in statute and paraphrased here:</p><p></p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph shift-right\">\r\n<ul><li>The age and health of the parties;</li><li>The present or future earning capacity of the parties;</li><li>The need of one party to incur training or education expenses;</li><li>The termination of a child support award before the termination of the maintenance award when the calculation of maintenance was based on child support being awarded which resulted in a maintenance award lower than it would have been...;</li><li>The wasteful dissipation of marital property;</li><li>The existence and duration of a pre-marital joint household or post-divorce separate household;</li><li>Acts by one party against another that have inhibited or continue to inhibit a party's earning capacity or ability to obtain meaningful employment;</li><li>The availability or cost of medical insurance for the parties;</li><li>The care of children or stepchildren, disabled adult children or stepchildren, elderly parents or in-laws provided during the marriage that inhibits a party's earning capacity;</li><li>The tax consequences to each party;</li><li>The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage;</li><li>The reduced or lost earning capacity of the payee as a result of having foregone or delayed education, training, employment or career opportunities during the marriage;</li><li>The equitable distribution of marital property and the income or imputed income on the assets so distributed;</li><li>The contributions and services of the payee as a spouse, parent, wage earner and homemaker to the career potential of the other party;</li><li>Any other relevant factors.</li></ul><p>Post-divorce maintenance ceases upon the death of either party or the remarriage of the receiving party. It can, in some cases, be modified.</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<h4>Alimony in New Jersey</h4>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>The main New Jersey statute involving alimony is NJ Rev Stat sec. 2A:34-23 (2016).</p><p>The provision sets forth four types of alimony: open durational alimony; rehabilitative alimony; limited duration alimony; or reimbursement alimony. In considering which type of alimony to award, New Jersey courts must consider the following non-exhaustive list of factors:</p>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph shift-right\">\r\n<ul><li>The actual need and ability of the parties to pay;</li>\r\n<li>The duration of the marriage or civil union;</li>\r\n<li>The age [and the] physical and emotional health of the parties;</li>\r\n<li>The standard of living established in the marriage or civil union and the likelihood that each party can maintain a reasonably comparable standard of living, with neither party having a greater entitlement to that standard of living than the other;</li><li>The earning capacities, educational levels, vocational skills, and employability of the parties;</li><li>The length of absence from the job market of the party seeking maintenance;</li><li>The parental responsibilities for the children;</li><li>The time and expense necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking maintenance to find appropriate employment, the availability of the training and employment, and the opportunity for future acquisitions of capital assets and income;</li><li>The history of financial or non-financial contributions to the marriage or civil union by each party...;</li><li>The equitable distribution of property ordered and any payouts on equitable distribution, directly or indirectly, out of current income...;</li><li>The income available to either party through investments of any assets held by that party;</li><li>The tax treatment and consequences to both parties of any alimony award...;</li><li>The nature, amount, and length of any pendite lite support paid, if any; and</li><li>Any other factors which the court may deem relevant.</li></ul>\r\n</section>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>Barring \"exceptional circumstances,\" for cases in New Jersey involving marriages or civil unions that lasted less than 20 years, the duration of alimony will not exceed the length of the marriage or civil union. \"Exceptional circumstances\" are defined in statute.</p><p>Rehabilitative alimony is awarded based upon a rehabilitation plan of the payee and may be modified. &nbsp;Reimbursement alimony may be awarded \"under circumstances in which one party supported the other through an advanced education, anticipating participation in the fruits of the earning capacity generated by that education\" and may not be modified under any circumstances. Other types of alimony may be subsequently modified based on specified factors. Alimony will generally terminate upon death, re-marriage, or (in most cases) the retirement of the obligor.</p><p></p></section><section class=\"published-paragraph\"><h4>How We Can Help</h4>\r\n</section>\r\n<section class=\"published-paragraph\">\r\n<p>Alimony can often be one of the most contentious issues in a divorce, especially where there exists a significant difference in income between the parties.
