In addition to the emotional costs of divorce, the divorce process poses real financial burdens on individuals and families. Here at The Law Offices of Grinberg &amp; Segal, we offer several fixed-price plans for certain types of uncontested divorces in New York and New Jersey. When you choose one of your fixed-price divorce packages, you are ensuring that you will receive the best representation at a very reasonable price. We also offer a number of packages relating to prenuptual agreements, postnuptual agreements, and separation agreements.
