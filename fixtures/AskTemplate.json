The \u201cAsk a Question\u201d feature is designed for you to ask questions about general \u2013 family law issues and not fact-specific questions about your case.

Only when the Retainer Agreement is fully executed and the requisite retainer fee is paid by you to the Firm, when applicable, will you become a client of the Firm and a formal\u2002lasting attorney-client relationship will be created.
