In effect, the new rules will apply to divorces that are finalized beginning in 2019.  The article suggests that the new rules may prompt some to move to finalize their divorces before the new tax rules kick in.  \n\nAlimony is not an issue in every divorce matter.  However, in many divorce negotiations and divorce proceedings, alimony is one of the most pressing issues in the case.\n\nIn complicated cases, a party to a divorce can benefit greatly from the counsel of an experienced family law attorney who understands the divorce laws of the state having jurisdiction over the divorce.  At The Law Offices of Grinberg & Segal, PLLC, we handle all types of New York and New Jersey divorce matters, from relatively simple uncontested divorces to highly complicated contested divorces.  Where applicable, we consider alimony in the context of divorce negotiations and proceedings and work to offer our clients the best representation in New York and New Jersey .

The book, titled \u201cGray Divorce:  What We Lose and Gain from Mid-Life Splits\u201d is authored by Jocelyn Elise Crowley, Ph.D., a professor and researcher at Rutgers University.  The article discusses many of Crowley\u2019s research findings regarding \u201cgray divorces.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the article, we learn that the rate of \u201cgray divorces\u201d has increased sharply in recent years.  From 1990-2010, the rate of \u201cgray divorces\u201d doubled, and approximately one out of every four divorces today involves at least one party who is at least 50 years old.\r\n\r\nAlthough age far from dispositive as to the complexity of the divorce, many older couples are likely to have more assets to negotiate than younger couples.  In this sense, the uptick in gray divorces may often correspond with an uptick in highly complex divorce matters.  In cases where there are significant assets at stake, parties to a divorce may benefit greatly from the counsel of an experienced divorce attorney who can help protect their interests and work toward an amicable agreement on as many of the contested  issues as possible.\r\n\r\nSource:  Lamberg, Erica.  \u201cRutgers professor writes book about mid-life divorce trends.\u201d  myCentralJersey.

The data were compiled from U.S. Census Bureau data.  Since we handle uncontested divorces and contested divorces in both New Jersey uncontested divorces and contested divorces and New York uncontested divorces and contested divorces, we will examine their findings for New Jersey and New York.\r\n\r\nFirst, the 24/7 Wall Street report found that Crestwood Village, New Jersey, has the highest divorce rate of any city in New Jersey.  In Crestwood Village, the percent of the population aged 15 years or older that has been divorced is 16.4%.  This is nearly double the 8.5% number for New Jersey statewide.  44.1% of the population of Crestwood Village is married.  The median household income in Crestwood Village is $28,282, and only 8.0% of households earn less than $10,000.\r\n\r\nNext, the report found that Hudson, New York, has the highest divorce rate of any city in New York.  The divorced population constituted 16.7% of all people in Hudson aged 15 or older.  This was significantly higher than the 8.7% rate for New York statewide.  Only 29.6% of the population in Hudson, New York, is married.  The median household income in Hudson is $31,042, but 13.3% of households in Hudson earn less than $10,000.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the survey shows that the percentage of divorced populations of New Jersey and New York statewide is similar.  Furthermore, the cities in each state with the highest divorce rates also had several similar statistics.\r\n\r\nSource:  Harrington, John and Cheyenne Buckingham.  \u201cThe Divorce Capital of Every State.\u201d  24/7 Wall St, Jan. 29, 2018.  https://247wallst.com/special-report/2018/01/29/divorce-capital-of-every-state/", "author": 15, "category": 3, "is_archived": false, "is_flagged": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_published": true, "image": "", "total_comments": 0}}]
